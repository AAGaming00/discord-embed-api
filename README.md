# discord-embed-api

My API for creating custom link embeds for Discord.

Hosted with Heroku so I don't have to worry about a lot of stuff such as storing data efficiently; especially since this API does extremely minimal calculations. Everything is saved in RAM so embed links will be purged when it (probably never) uses up all of the Heroku server's allocated RAM.

# Data That's Logged

 - What you made.
 - What embed ID that data was saved to.

No IP addresses are logged or saved. All data is anonymous.

I am not responsable the releasing of any personal information within logged data.

# Why is this data logged?

To keep track of how much the API is used, as well as to help with any errors that may occur.
