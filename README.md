# discord-embed-api

My API for creating custom link embeds for Discord.

Hosted with Heroku so I don't have to worry about a lot of stuff such as storing data efficiently; especially since this API does extremely minimal calculations. Everything is saved in RAM so embed links will be purged when it (probably never) uses up all of the Heroku server's allocated RAM.
